This ZenPack provides support for monitoring Microsoft Windows. Monitoring is performed using the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and Windows Remote Shell (WinRS) to collect Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Perfmon data.

{{note}} This ZenPack supersedes the earlier ZenPack named ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' for Windows platforms that support WinRM. If you have ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' installed on your system, please read the [[#Transitioning from WindowsMonitor]] section below.

== <span style="color:firebrick">Controlled Availability</span> ==
This ZenPack is in a controlled release while it undergoes final testing. Take all necessary precautions before deploying into a production environment.

=== Event Management ===
Events could be collected from the Windows event log using a WinRM subscription. Events collected through this mechanism will be timestamped based on the time they occurred within the Windows event log. Not by the time at which they were collected.

To monitor EventLog events you should add to monitoring template "Windows EventLog" datasource, and in the Event Log field put the name of event log, that you are interested in, and in the EventQuery you could put the filter for events. Filter is written as PowerShell scriptblock for Where-Object comandlet. 

For example, here is Event Query for error events only:

    { $$_.EntryType -eq 'Error' }

<code>$$_</code> is the event object of EventLogEntry class. <code>EntryType</code> - is the attribute which determines severity, and could contain one of the following values: <code>Error, Warning, Information, SuccessAudit</code>, or <code>FailureAudit</code>. Also it has such attributes as <code>Message</code>, <code>MachineName</code>, <code>TimeGenerated</code>, <code>Source</code>. Full list you could find at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.diagnostics.eventlogentry .

And to know more about writing PowerShell conditions, you could read http://www.powershellpro.com/powershell-tutorial-introduction/powershell-tutorial-conditional-logic/ 


To change event severity follow the steps:
# go to IIS Site events, and click on '/Status' event class.
# find 'EventClass Mappings' section and click on 'IISSiteStatus' link
# click the ''Edit'' button
# in the 'Transform' section, add "<code>evt.severity = <severity number(see link http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-3923 in the '#7.1.1.3. severity Field' section)></code>" at the bottom
# click the ''Save'' button

== Requirements ==

This ZenPack has the following requirements.

;[[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector ZenPack]]
: This ZenPack depends on [[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector]] being installed, and having the associated ''zenpython'' collector process running.

;System Kerberos RPM
: The operating system's kerberos RPM must be installed. See the [[#Installing_Kerberos_Dependency]] section for details.

=== Installing Kerberos Dependency ===

To use kerberos authentication the operating system's kerberos package must be installed on all Zenoss servers. On Enterprise Linux (Red Hat and CentOS) this is the ''krb5-workstation'' RPM and can typically be installed by running the following command as the ''root'' user.

<console>
yum -y install krb5-workstation
</console>

== Usage ==

=== Adding a Windows Device ===

Use the following steps to start monitoring a Windows server using local authentication in the Zenoss web interface.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Select the Server/Microsoft/Windows device class.
# Click Details and set the configuration properties for zWinRMUser and zWinRMPassword.
# Click See All.
# Choose ''Add Single Device'' from the add device button.
# Fill out the form.
#* ''Name or IP'' must be resolvable and accessible from the collector server chosen in the ''Collector'' field.
# Click ''ADD''.

----

Alternatively you can use zenbatchload to add Windows servers from the command line. To do this, you must create a text file with hostname, username and password of all the servers you want to add. Multiple endpoints can be added under the same ''/Devices/Server/Microsoft/Windows'' section. Here is an example...

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
/Devices/Server/Microsoft/Windows
win2003-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
win2008-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
Win2012-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
</syntaxhighlight>

You can then load the Windows servers into Zenoss Core or Resource Manager as devices with the following command.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
zenbatchload <filename>
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Configuration Options ===

The [[#Adding a Windows Device]] steps shown above are for the simplest case of using Windows local authentication. The following configuration properties can be used to support monitoring other environments.

;zWinRMUser
: The syntax used for zWinRMUser controls whether Zenoss will attempt Windows local authentication or domain (kerberos) authentication. If the value of zWinRMUser is ''username'', local Windows authentication will be used. If zWinRMUser is ''username@example.com'', domain authentication will be used. The zWinKDC and potentially the zWinRMServerName properties become important.

;zWinRMPassword
: Password for user defined by ''zWinRMUser''.

;zWinKDC
: The zWinKDC property must be set if domain authentication is used. It must be the IP address of a valid Windows domain controller.

;zWinRMServerName
: This property should only be used in conjunction with domain authentication when the DNS PTR record for a monitored server's managed IP address does not resolve to the name by which the server is known in Active Directory. For example, if myserver1 is known as myserver1.ad.example.com by Active Directory and is being managed by IP address 192.51.100.21, but 192.51.100.21 resolves to www.example.com, you will have to set zWinRMServerName to ''myserver1.ad.example.com'' for domain authentication to work.

: If many Windows servers in your environment don't have DNS PTR records that match Active Directory, it is recommended that you set the name of the Zenoss device's to be the fully-qualified Active Directory name and set zWinRMServerName to ''${here/titleOrId}'' at the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class. This avoids the necessity of setting zWinRMServerName on every device.

: It is recommended to leave zWinRMServerName blank if local authentication is used, or DNS PTR records match Active Directory. This allows Zenoss to not rely on DNS resolution while monitoring, and avoids the overhead of configuring zWinRMServerName.

;zWinScheme
: This must be set to either ''http'' or ''https''. The default is ''http''.

;zWinRMPort
: The port on which the Windows server is listening for ''WinRM'' or ''WS-Management'' connections. The default is ''5985''. It is uncommon for this to be configured as anything else.

;zWinPerfmonInterval
: The default interval in seconds at which ''Windows Perfmon'' datapoints will be collected. The default is ''300'' seconds or 5 minutes. It is also possible to override the collection interval for individual counters.

;zWinKeyTabFilePath
: This property is currently used and reserved for future use when keytab files are supported.

;zDBInstances
: This setting is only relevant when the ''zenoss.winrm.WinMSSQL'' modeler plugin is enabled. Multiple instances can be specified to monitor multiple SQL Server instances per server. The default instance is ''MSSQLSERVER''. Fill in the user and password to use SQL authentication. Leave the user and password blank to use Windows authentication.

== Setting up WinRM Service for Target Windows Machines ==

Windows server operating systems from Windows 2003 SP1 are supported. The reason for this is that WinRM version 2 is required, and it was only added in Windows 2003 SP1.

* winrm s winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}

Basic Authentication (Windows default is Kerberos see note below for more information)
* winrm s winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}

{{note}} The above instructions use the max values for MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser and WinRS MaxShellsPerUser. If you do not want to set these to the max, then a value of 50 should be adequate. The default is 5 on both, which will cause problems because Zenoss will open up concurrent requests for each WQL query and set of Perfmon counters.

{{note}} If you choose to use Basic authentication it is highly recommended that you also configure HTTPS. If you do not use the HTTPS protocol your user name and password will be sent over in clear text. If you have challenges setting up HTTPS on the Windows clients and you don't mind sending the payload in clear text but require the user name and password to be encrypted then using the Kerberos authentication is the best option. HTTPS is not required for Kerberos but is recommended.

{{note}} If you choose to take the WinRM default configurations you must supply Kerberos authentication settings in the zProperties. The Kerberos authentication process requires a ticket granting server. In the Microsoft Active Directory environment the AD Server is also the KDC. The zWinKDC value must be set to the IP address of the AD Server and the collector must be able to sent TCP/IP packets to this server. Once this is set your zWinRMUserName must be a FQDN such as jsmith@Zenoss.com and the zWinRMPassword must be set correctly for this user account.

{{note}} The HTTPS setup must be completed on each client. At this time we do not have notes on automating this task but are currently in the process of testing several options. To successfully encrypt your payload between the Zenoss server and the Windows client you must install a Server Authentication certificate on tbe client machine. The process for requesting and installing the appropriate  certificate can be found at the following URL.
http://blogs.technet.com/b/meamcs/archive/2012/02/25/how-to-force-winrm-to-listen-interfaces-over-https.aspx
Once the client has the correct certificate installed you only need to change the zWinScheme to HTTPS and zWinRMPort to 5986. If you are still having challenges setting up HTTPS on the client you can execute the following command on any AD server to verify the appropriate  SPN record exists for Kerberos authentication.

setspn -l hostname1

If you do not see a record with HTTPS/ at the beginning of the hostname you will need to create the record.

example:
setspn -s HTTPS/hostname1.zenoss.com hostname1


== Transitioning from WindowsMonitor ==

If you are installing this ZenPack on an existing Zenoss system or upgrading from an earlier Zenoss version you may have a ZenPack named ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' already installed on your system. You can check this by navigating to Advanced -> ZenPacks.

This ZenPack functionally supersedes ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' for Windows platforms that support WinRM, but does not automatically migrate monitoring of your Microsoft Windows resources when installed. The ZenPacks can coexist gracefully to allow you time to manually transition monitoring to the newer ZenPack with better capabilities.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Expand the Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Single-click to select a Windows device.
# Click the delete (''-'') button in the bottom-left.
# Click OK to confirm deleting the Windows device.
# Add the device back using the [[#Adding a Windows Device]] instructions above. Be sure to select the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class and not the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Repeat steps 3-6 for each Windows device.

Old Windows ZenPacks:
* PySamba
* WindowsMonitor
* ActiveDirectory
* IISMonitor
* MSExchange
* MSMQMonitor
* MSSQLServer

New Windows ZenPacks:
* [[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector]] is a requirement for this ZenPack. It provides the polling facility through the zenpython collector daemon.
* This ZenPack (all the functionality of the old Windows ZenPacks is rolled into this one ZenPack)

The old ZenPacks come as part of the Zenoss Core 4.2.x RPM. They can be installed on top of an RM install with the msmonitor RPM

=== Using Old and New Windows ZenPacks Together ===

There are some scenarios where it may be useful to use the old and new Windows ZenPacks together. In most cases this is as simple as putting servers you wish to be monitored by the new ZenPack in the /Server/Microsoft/Server device class and servers you wish to be monitored by the old ZenPack in the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.

Due to this ZenPack's dependency on WinRM 2.0 it is not possible to monitor Windows versions earlier than Windows 2003 SP1. If you have a requirement to monitor these earlier Windows versions you must use the older [[ZenPack::Microsoft_Windows|WindowsMonitor ZenPack]] that uses DCOM/RPC instead of WinRM.

There are also circumstances where you may currently be using the old Windows ZenPack and only want to initially use the new ZenPack for its new functionalities such as the ''Windows Shell'' datasource. This can be achieved using the following steps.

# Keep the servers under the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Verify that all of the following configuration properties are set:
#* ''zWinUser'': In DOMAIN\Username format for DCOM/RPC collection.
#* ''zWinPassword'': Password for zWinUser account.
#* ''zWinRMUser'': In username@example.com format for WinRM collection.
#* ''zWinRMPassword'': Password for zWinRMUser account.
# Create a monitoring template containing a ''Windows Shell'' datasource and bind it to the server.

== Limitations of Current Release ==

The current release is known to have the following limitations.

* Support for team NICs is limited to Intel and Broadcom interfaces.
* The custom widget for MSSQL Server credentials is not compatible with Zenoss 4.1.x, therefore the ''zDBInstances'' property
in this version should be set as a valid JSON list (e.g. ''[{"instance": "MSSQLSERVER", "user": "", "passwd": ""}]'' ).

A current list of known issues related to this ZenPack can be found with [https://jira.zenoss.com/issues/?jql=%22Affected%20Zenpack(s)%22%20%3D%20MicrosoftWindows%20AND%20status%20not%20in%20(closed%2C%20%22awaiting%20verification%22)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20id this JIRA query]. You must be logged into JIRA to run this query. If you don't already have a JIRA account, you can [https://jira.zenoss.com/secure/Signup!default.jspa create one here].

=== Manually Establishing Kerberos Tickets ===

In version 2.0.0 of the ZenPack there is a problem in the automatic establishment of kerberos tickets required for monitoring Windows devices using kerberos authentication. This is only a problem on Enterprise Linux 5 (Red Hat or CentOS). It is not a problem on Enterprise Linux 6. The problem will typically manifest as the following error when attempting to model a Windows device.

{{note}} Note that these manual steps are not necessary in version 2.0.1 and later of the ZenPack.

<blockquote>
kerberos authGSSClientStep failed (None)
</blockquote>

It is possible to workaround this error by manually establishing the tokens using the following steps.

# Edit $ZENHOME/var/krb5/krb5.conf.
## Remove the ''includedir'' line.
## Add the following to the bottom of the file.

<pre>
[realms]
 EXAMPLE1.COM = {
  kdc = 192.168.77.77 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
  admin_server = 192.168.77.77 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
 }
 EXAMPLE2.COM = {
  kdc = 192.168.88.88 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
  admin_server = 192.168.88.88 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
 }

[domain_realm]
 .example1.com = EXAMPLE1.COM
 example1.com = EXAMPLE1.COM
 .example2.com = EXAMPLE2.COM
 example2.com = EXAMPLE2.COM
</pre>

This is an example of what would be required if you had two domains: example1.com and example2.com with domain controllers at 192.168.77.77 and 192.168.88.88 respectively. You can use a single domain or more than two. Be sure to use the same capitalization scheme.

== Service Impact ==

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds built-in service impact capability for services running on Microsoft Windows. The following service impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included in any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.

;Service Impact Relationships
* The Windows server is impacted by the Processors, Interfaces and File Systems.

== Troubleshooting ==

Please refer the the Zenoss Service Dynamics documentation if you run into any of the following problems:

* ZenPack will not install
* Adding a device fails
* Don't understand how to add a device
* Don't understand how to model a device

If you cannot find the answer in the documentation, then Resource Manager (Service Dynamics) users should contact [https://support.zenoss.com Zenoss Customer Support]. Core users can use the #zenoss IRC channel or the community.zenoss.org forums (there is a forum specific to Windows monitoring).
