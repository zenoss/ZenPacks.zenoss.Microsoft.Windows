This ZenPack provides support for monitoring Microsoft Windows. Monitoring is performed using the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and Windows Remote Shell (WinRS) to collect Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Perfmon data.

{{note}} This ZenPack supersedes the earlier ZenPack named ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' for Windows platforms that support WinRM. If you have ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' installed on your system, please read the [[#Transitioning from WindowsMonitor]] section below.

=== Performance Monitoring ===

Perfmon counters are collected using the PowerShell Get-Counter Cmdlet within a remove shell (WinRS). The following metrics will be collected every 5 minutes by default. Any other Windows Perfmon counters can also be collected by adding them to the appropriate monitoring template.

{{note}} Performance counters are language specific, so you must use the counter(s) for your service account's language.  The counters listed below are shipped with the ZenPack.  If your server does not have the English language pack installed and it is not possible to install it, Zenoss recommends creating a subclass below ''/Server/Microsoft/Windows'', making copies of the existing templates, and replacing the counters in the datasources with the non-English equivalents.  You ''must'' also update the zWinRMLocale property with the appropriate culture of your service account.  For example, native French locale would be 'fr-FR'.  The full list of cultures can be found at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx.

* \SQLServer:Databases(<dbname>)\Repl. Trans. Rate
* \SQLServer:Databases(<dbname>)\Shrink Data Movement Bytes/sec
* \SQLServer:Databases(<dbname>)\Transactions/sec

You can enable/disable any of these or change the cycle time by editing the WinDatabase monitoring template.

Events will be sent depending upon one or more of the following statuses of the database

* AutoClosed:  The database has been automatically closed.
* EmergencyMode: The database is in emergency mode.
* Inaccessible: The database is inaccessible. The server might be switched off or the network connection has been interrupted.
* Normal: The database is available.
* Offline: The database has been taken offline.
* Recovering: The database is going through the recovery process.
* RecoveryPending: The database is waiting to go through the recovery process.
* Restoring: The database is going through the restore process.
* Shutdown: The server on which the database resides has been shut down.
* Standby: The database is in standby mode.
* Suspect: The database has been marked as suspect. You will have to check the data, and the database might have to be restored from a backup.

'Normal' will send a clear event
'EmergencyMode' will send a critical event
'Inaccessible', 'Suspect', 'Shutdown' will send Error events
'RecoveryPending', 'Restoring', 'Recovering', 'Standby', 'AutoClosed', 'Offline' will send Warning events

Status can be multiple items from above.  For example, taking a database offline will set the status to 'Offline, AutoClosed'.

The WinDBInstance monitoring template will monitor the status of a SQL Server instance to inform the user if it is up or down.

The WinSQLJob monitoring template will monitor the status of a job on a SQL Server instance to inform the user if it has succeeded, failed, unknown, or other state.

=== Thresholds ===

The following thresholds are set by default on the device monitoring template and will trigger an alert if they are reached

* CPU Utilization - 90% used
* Paging File Usage - 95% used
* Memory - 90% of total memory used

=== Event Management ===
Events could be collected from the Windows event log using a WinRM subscription. Events collected through this mechanism will be timestamped based on the time they occurred within the Windows event log. Not by the time at which they were collected.

To monitor EventLog events you should add to monitoring template with "Windows EventLog" datasource. For the Event Log field put the name of event log (e.g. "System") that you are interested in, and in the EventQuery you could put the filter for events. The filter can be either a PowerShell Where-Object block or XPath XML taken from a Windows Event Viewer Custom View.

The default Get-WinEvent xml filter returns all events from the last polling cycle.  This list can be searched for specific Ids, severity, or specific words in the message using PowerShell.

* To target all events with a Warning or higher severity:

[[File:CustomViewOptions.png|thumb|250px|CustomViewOptions]]
For servers with pre-3.5 .NET installed: <code>{ $$_.EntryType -le [System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType]::Warning}</code>

<code>$$_</code> is the event object of EventLogEntry class. <code>EntryType</code> is the attribute which determines severity, and could contain one of the following values: <code>Error, Warning, Information, SuccessAudit,<code> or</code> <code>FailureAudit</code>. Also it has such attributes as <code>Message, MachineName, TimeGenerated, Source</code>. Full list you could find at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.diagnostics.eventlogentry .

Note: This query is structured to look for "less than," although we are looking for events "greater than" in severity. This is because the EntryType is an enumeration where the integer values map to 1= Error, 2 = Warning, etc. This means lower numbers indicate higher severity.

For servers with .NET 3.5 & Later:

<code>{ $$_.Level -le [System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.StandardEventLevel]::Warning}</code>

Or to look for a specific event id:

<code>{ $$_.Id -eq 4001}</code>

<code>$$_</code> is the event object of EventLogRecord class. <code>Level</code> is the severity of the event.  <code>Id</code> is the property to compare for specific event ids.  You can find the full listing of properties at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh849682.aspx.

Note: This query is structured to look for "less than or equal" although we are looking for events "greater than or equal" in severity. This is because the Level is an enumeration where the integer values map to 1 = Critical, 2 = Error, 3 = Warning, etc. This means lower numbers indicate higher severity.  The LogAlways event level evaluates to 0, which is less than a Warning.  These events are typically Informational and will display if using the sample powershell query above.  To work around this, you could add <code> -and $$_.Level -gt [System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.StandardEventLevel]::LogAlways</code> into your query or use the xml option.

[[File:CustomViewXML.png|thumb|250px|CustomViewXML]]
The full list of event levels can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.reader.standardeventlevel%28v=vs.110%29.aspx

For more information about the System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader class, you could read http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.reader(v=vs.110).aspx

And to know more about writing PowerShell conditions, you could read http://www.powershellpro.com/powershell-tutorial-introduction/powershell-tutorial-conditional-logic/ 

* To use the xml query from a custom view in Windows Event Viewer, simply copy the xml and paste into the Event Query field of the event data source.  Because we use a polling cycle to query the event log, any TimeCreated filter will be replaced by us to avoid duplicate events.

For example, a custom view that searches for events in the last hour, with severity of Warning or Critical, and Ids of 104, 110-115, 155 will result in the following XPath query:
[[File:EventDatasourceXML.PNG|thumb|250px|EventDatasourceXML]]
    <QueryList>
      <Query Id="0" Path="Application">
        <Select Path="Application">*[System[(Level=1  or Level=3) and (EventID=104 or  (EventID &gt;= 110 and EventID &lt;= 115)  or EventID=155) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= 3600000]]]</Select>
      </Query>
    </QueryList>

Simply copy this and paste into the eventlog datasource Event Query field and save.  We will convert the TimeCreated query and the following filter will be used:

    <QueryList>
      <Query Id="0" Path="Application">
        <Select Path="Application">*[System[(Level=1  or Level=3) and (EventID=104 or  (EventID &gt;= 110 and EventID &lt;= 115)  or EventID=155) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= {time}]]]</Select>
      </Query>
    </QueryList>

'{time}' will be replaced by the number of milliseconds since the last query.

{{note}} The script to search for events and return relevant data is approximately 3700 characters.  Due to the Windows 8192 character limit on the shell, any XML or PowerShell queries will need to be less than 4400 characters.

{{note}} The query for servers with .NET 3.5 and later uses the Get-WinEvent PowerShell cmdlet.  If your server does not have one of these later versions, we will revert to using the Get-EventLog cmdlet.  It is recommended, but not required, to install .NET version 3.5 SP1 or higher.  If you have a mix of these servers using the same Event Log Data Source, you can mix and match the differing powershell queries.  e.g. <code>{ $$_.Id -eq 4001 -or $$_.EventId -eq 4001 }</code>

To change event severity follow the steps:
# go to IIS Site events, and click on '/Status' event class.
# find 'EventClass Mappings' section and click on 'IISSiteStatus' link
# click the ''Edit'' button
# in the 'Transform' section, add "<code>evt.severity = NUM</code>" where NUM is one of (0: Clear, 1: Debug, 2: Info, 3: Warning, 4: Error, 5: Critical) at the bottom
# click the ''Save'' button

=== Custom Commands ===
You can use the custom command datasource in the Windows ZenPack to create custom data points, graphs and thresholds.

* Use either DOS shell commands or Powershell script
** Use any valid Windows executable or Powershell cmdlet
** Powershell commands separated by ';'.  Always end script with ';'
** For tales eval, surround by single quotes.  e.g. '${here/id}'
** For Powershell variables, use 2 '$'.  e.g. $$myvar = 10
** There is a character limit of 8192 imposed by Microsoft.  Zenoss header is ~450 characters so you have about 7500 characters for your script.
* Use standard parser to parse the output or create your own
** Nagios have the form <key>=<value>
** JSON - script must put data into JSON format
** Auto will save a returned value into a data point.
** Create custom parser in $ZENOSS_HOME/Products/ZenRRD/parsers/
* Viewing script output
** Create datapoint(s) to collect the data for graphing
** Create custom parser to send event or transform data

==== Example usage ====

;Script with TALES expression
# Select a windows target device
# Navigate to Device (/Server/Microsoft)
# On the right side panel, click '+' to add a 'Windows Shell' datasource
# Provide name (eg. custom) and type (Windows Shell) for the datasource
# View Edit and Details
# Set strategy to custom command
# Set parser to Nagios
# Uncheck Use Powershell
# Set script to echo 'OK^|value1=${here/zWinPerfmonInterval}'
# Add data point to data source called value1 which can be graphed

;Using a custom parser
Logon to the zenoss server and create a python file called test1.py in /opt/zenoss/Products/ZenRRD/parsers and restart zenoss

The content of test1.py

 <nowiki>
from Products.ZenRRD.CommandParser import CommandParser
 class test1(CommandParser):
    def processResults(self, cmd, result):
        result.events.append({
            'summary':'test1 parser event',
            'severity': 5,
            'test1.detail': cmd.deviceConfig.name,
            })
</nowiki>

# Select a windows target device
# Navigate to Device (/Server/Microsoft)
# On the right side panel, click '+' to add a 'Windows Shell' datasource
# Provide name (eg. custom) and type (Windows Shell) for the datasource
# View Edit and Details : strategy ->custom command and parser is test1
# Run zenpython to collect the data zenpython run -v10 -d <devicename>
# Check events after 5 minutes for the test1 event

;Powershell Scripting using Auto parser

# Select a windows target device
# Navigate to Device (/Server/Microsoft)
# On the right side panel, click '+' to add a 'Windows Shell' datasource
# Provide name (eg. custom) and type (Windows Shell) for the datasource
# View Edit and Details : strategy ->custom command, parser is Auto, and tick the Use Powershell box
# Enter script.  Be sure to use a double dollar sign, '$$', in order to distinguish any powershell specific variables from a TALES expression.
# Add a datapoint to collect the return value from the script which you can then graph

=== Configuring Service Monitoring ===

There are multiple ways to configure Windows service monitoring depending on if you want to configure for a single service on a single server, a specific service across all Windows servers, all 'Auto' start services, or somewhere in between.

[[File:winservice.png|thumb|320px|WinService]]

==== Options ====
* Name - Enter a name for the data source
* Enabled - Enable or disable the data source
* Severity - Choose the severity of the alert
* Cycle Time - Frequency of how often the datasource will query service status
* Update services immediately - Changes will be picked up during modeling.  To have changes take effect immediately, check this box to start a job to index all services on all devices.  This job could take several minutes to complete as it will update every service component on every Windows device in the system.
* Service Options - Select the start type(s) to monitor.  Add any services to include/exclude using a regex
* Service Status - Choose to be alerted if a service is either not Running or not Stopped

See the following examples:

;Manually Enable or disable monitoring for a single service on a single server.
# Navigate to the service on the server.
# Click to select it.
# Select ''Details'' in the lower component pane.
# Choose the Fail Severity.
# Choose ''Monitoring'' from the gear menu.
# Choose Yes or No depending on what you want.

{{note}} Once monitoring has been enabled or disabled for a service, no monitoring template will apply.  To reset this option for a service, uncheck the 'Manually Selected Monitor State' box in the Details of the service and save the change.  This check box does not enable or disable monitoring for the service component.

;Enable monitoring by default for the WinRM service wherever it is enabled.
Option 1
# Navigate to Advanced -> Monitoring Templates.
# Verify the list of templates is grouped by template.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree.
# Click once to select the ''/Server/Microsoft'' copy.
# Choose ''Copy / Override Template'' from the Template gear menu at the bottom left of the page.
# Select ''/Server/Microsoft (Create Copy)'' from the target list then click submit.
# Expand the resulting ''copy_of_WinService'' tree.
# Select the ''/Server/Microsoft'' copy.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the Template gear menu at the bottom left of the page.
# Change the template's name to ''WinRM''.
# Edit the datasource and optionally select the ''Update services immediately'' option.
# Tick the ''Auto'' checkbox under ''Service Options'' and click save.

Option 2
# Navigate to Infrastructure -> Windows Services
# Locate the WinRM service
# Select the start modes desired for this service
# Enable monitoring by setting a Local Value
# Optionally select a Local Failure Severity
# Save

{{note}} Setting a service to be monitored in this fashion will enable monitoring for the service regardless of device class.

;Enable/Disable monitoring by default for the WinRM service for a select group of servers.
# Create a new device class somewhere under ''/Server/Microsoft/Windows'' for the select group of servers.
# Move the servers to the new device class.
# Follow steps 1-5 from the previous section to create a copy of the WinService template.
# Choose your new device class as the target then click submit.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree then select the copy in your device class.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the gear menu at the bottom left of the page.
# Change the template's name to ''WinRM'' then click submit.
# Double-click to edit the ''DefaultService' datasource.
# Optionally select the ''Update services immediately'' option.  This will start a background job that could take several minutes to complete for a large number of Windows devices.
# Tick/Untick the ''Auto'' checkbox under ''Service Options'' and click save.

;Enable monitoring of all services with a start mode of 'Auto'.
# Navigate to Advanced -> Monitoring Templates.
# Verify the list of templates is grouped by template.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree.
# Select ''/Server/Microsoft''.
# In the Data Sources pane, click the + button to add a new data source, give it a name, and choose Windows Service as the type.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the Data Sources gear menu.
# Optionally select the ''Update services immediately'' option.  This will start a background job that could take several minutes to complete for a large number of Windows devices.
# Tick the ''Auto'' checkbox under ''Service Options'' and click save.

;Create an organizer to monitor auto start SQL Server services.
# Navigate to Advanced -> Monitoring Templates.
# Verify the list of templates is grouped by template.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree.
# Select ''/Server/Microsoft''.
# In the Data Sources pane, click the + button to add a new data source, give it a name such as MSSQLSERVER, and choose Windows Service as the type.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the Data Sources gear menu.
# Optionally select the ''Update services immediately'' option.  This will start a background job that could take several minutes to complete for a large number of Windows devices.
# Tick the ''Auto'' checkbox under ''Service Options''.
# Enter ''+MSSQLSERVER.*'' into the "Inclusions(+)/Exclusions(-)" text box and click save.

The order of precedence for monitoring a service is:

{{note}} The Windows Service Template (default WinService) must have at least one datasource enabled for monitoring to function.

You can optionally include or exclude certain services to be monitored when selecting the ''Auto'', ''Manual'', and/or ''Disabled'' start mode(s) by entering a comma separated list of services.  These can be the service names or a valid regular expression.  Entered names and expressions are case insensitive.  To exclude services, you must specify a '-' at the beginning of the name or regular expression.  To include services, specify a '+' at the beginning of the name or regular expression.  Exclusions will take precedence over inclusions, but the exclusions must be placed before the wildcard ''+.*'' inclusion.

{{note}} To enable monitoring by default of a service or services, you must choose a start mode by ticking the appropriate box.  Unticking all three boxes disables monitoring by default.

{{note}} When saving changes to a service template and you choose to update services immediately, this will create a job to index all services on all devices.  These changes may take several minutes to propagate to all of your devices depending upon the size of your organization.  Updating is not recommended if you are making several changes in a short period of time.  Updates are automatically applied at the time of the next model.

{{note}} The Windows Service datasource no longer depends on the 'DefaultService' data source name.  User defined datasources are now honored.

=== DCDiag ===

Beginning with version 2.4.0, you can now monitor the output of DCDiag.  By default all dcdiag tests are enabled in the Active Directory monitoring template.  If a test fails an error event is issued.  You can also add other tests, such as DNS, and supply specific test parameters.

See https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731968.aspx for more information on DCDiag.

{{note}} DCDiag must be run as a user with Administrator permissions.  If you will be monitoring a Domain Controller with a non administrator user, you should disable these tests.

=== PortCheck ===

Beginning with version 2.4.0, you can now monitor specific ports in the Windows Zenpack.  By default, the ZenPack will monitor ports 9389, 3268, 3269, 88, 464, 389, 636, 445, 135, and 3389, as part of the Active Directory monitoring template.

You can add and remove any port you wish to be monitored by editing the PortCheck datasource in the Active Directory monitoring template.

To monitor ports on a Windows server that is not a domain controller, simply create a new datasource and choose Windows PortCheck as the type.  Then add the ports you wish to monitor with a short description of each.

See https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772723(v=ws.10).aspx for more information on Active Directory port usage.

=== WinRM Ping ===

WinRM Ping is a simple datasource that will attempt to retrieve basic data over winrm.  If the device cannot return a simple query, then Zenoss will view this device as being down.  An event will appear in the /Status/Winrm/Ping event class with any resulting error message.  This is a more comprehensive test than using a ping.  A simple ping test could easily result in a false positive in many scenarios.  The following are just a few:

* A target's IP has been reassigned to a non-Windows device between models.
* The winrm service has stopped and cannot be restarted.
* The monitoring user account password has expired.

This datasource is not enabled by default.

== Requirements ==

This ZenPack has the following requirements.

;[[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector ZenPack]]
: This ZenPack depends on [[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector]] being installed, and having the associated ''zenpython'' collector process running.

;[[ZenPack:ZenPackLib|ZenPackLib ZenPack]]
: This ZenPack depends on [[ZenPack:ZenPackLib|ZenPackLib]] being installed.

;System Kerberos RPM
: The operating system's kerberos RPM must be installed. See the [[#Installing_Kerberos_Dependency]] section for details.

{{note}} During ZenPack installation, a job to reindex Windows Services may start.  It is recommended to either stop zenjobs before installing or to wait until the job finishes before restarting Zenoss.  If you restart before the job finishes, you may need to Abort and/or Delete the job after the restart.

=== Installing Kerberos Dependency ===

To use kerberos authentication the operating system's kerberos package must be installed on all Zenoss servers. On Enterprise Linux (Red Hat and CentOS) this is the ''krb5-workstation'' RPM and can typically be installed by running the following command as the ''root'' user.

<console>
yum -y install krb5-workstation
</console>

== Usage ==

=== Monitoring User Account ===

A monitoring user account must be either an Administrator or a least privileged user.

The Least Privileged User requires the following privileges and permissions:

* Enable, Method Execute, Read Security, Remote Access to the following WMI namespaces
** "Root"
** "Root/CIMv2"
** "Root/DEFAULT"
** "Root/RSOP"
** "Root/RSOP/Computer"
** "Root/WMI"
** "Root/CIMv2/Security/MicrosoftTpm"
If IIS is installed, one of the following namespaces depending upon IIS version
** "Root/Webadministration"
** "Root/microsoftiisv2"
* Permission to use the winrm service
* ReadPermissions, ReadKey, EnumerateSubKeys, QueryValues rights to the following registry keys
** "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib",
** "HKLM:\system\currentcontrolset\control\securepipeservers\winreg",
** "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002bE10318}",
** "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Blfp\Parameters\Adapters",
** "HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server",
** "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server"
* Membership in the following local groups or domain level groups for a Domain Controller
** "Performance Monitor Users",
** "Performance Log Users",
** "Event Log Readers",
** "Distributed COM Users",
** "WinRMRemoteWMIUsers__"
* “Read Folder” access to "C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config" if it exists
* Each service needs the following permissions
** SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG
** SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS
** SERVICE_INTERROGATE
** READ_CONTROL
** SERVICE_START

{{note}} An Administrator level user can be denied local logon and remote desktop access through a group policy object.

=== Port Requirements ===

The ZenPack communicates with a Windows device over port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS requests.  Compatible ports of 80 and 443 are also acceptable.
For domain authentication, Kerberos communicates on port 88 of the KDC and on port 749 of the Admin Server.

=== Adding a Windows Device ===

Use the following steps to start monitoring a Windows server using local authentication in the Zenoss web interface.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Select the Server/Microsoft/Windows device class.
#* The Windows server must be added to this class or to a child of this class.
# Click Details and set the configuration properties for zWinRMUser and zWinRMPassword.
# Click See All.
# Choose ''Add Single Device'' from the add device button.
# Fill out the form.
#* ''Name or IP'' must be resolvable and accessible from the collector server chosen in the ''Collector'' field.
# Click ''ADD''.

----

Alternatively you can use zenbatchload to add Windows servers from the command line. To do this, you must create a text file with hostname, username and password of all the servers you want to add. Multiple endpoints can be added under the same ''/Devices/Server/Microsoft/Windows'' section. Here is an example...

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
/Devices/Server/Microsoft/Windows
win2008-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
Win2012-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
</syntaxhighlight>

You can then load the Windows servers into Zenoss Core or Resource Manager as devices with the following command.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
zenbatchload <filename>
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Configuration Options ===

The [[#Adding a Windows Device]] steps shown above are for the simplest case of using Windows local authentication. The following configuration properties can be used to support monitoring other environments.

;zWinRMUser
: The syntax used for zWinRMUser controls whether Zenoss will attempt Windows local authentication or domain (kerberos) authentication. If the value of zWinRMUser is ''username'', local Windows authentication will be used. If zWinRMUser is ''username@example.com'', domain authentication will be used. The zWinKDC and potentially the zWinRMServerName properties become important.

;zWinRMPassword
: Password for user defined by ''zWinRMUser''.

;zWinKDC
: The zWinKDC property must be set if domain authentication is used.  It must be the IP address or resolvable name of a valid Windows domain controller.  To use multiple KDCs, you can enter a comma separated list of valid addresses or supply different KDCs across different Device Classes.  See the Kerberos Tickets section for more information.

;zWinTrustedRealm
: Enter the name of the domain which is trusted by the user's domain.  This can be a child or other domain which has a trust relationship with the user's domain.  For example, if zWinRMUser is ''username@example.com'', and austin.example.com is a child of the example domain, enter ''austin.example.com'' into zWinTrustedRealm.

;zWinTrustedKDC
: This property must be set if zWinTrustedRealm is set.  It must be the IP address or resolvable name of a valid Windows domain controller for the trusted realm.

;zWinRMServerName
: This property should only be used in conjunction with domain authentication when the DNS PTR record for a monitored server's managed IP address does not resolve to the name by which the server is known in Active Directory. For example, if myserver1 is known as myserver1.ad.example.com by Active Directory and is being managed by IP address 192.51.100.21, but 192.51.100.21 resolves to www.example.com, you will have to set zWinRMServerName to ''myserver1.ad.example.com'' for domain authentication to work.

: If many Windows servers in your environment don't have DNS PTR records that match Active Directory, it is recommended that you set the name of the Zenoss device's to be the fully-qualified Active Directory name and set zWinRMServerName to ''${here/titleOrId}'' at the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class. This avoids the necessity of setting zWinRMServerName on every device.

: If the server name cannot be resolved and you are using domain authentication, it is recommended that you set the Id of the device to the IP address and the Title to the server name it is known by in Active Directory.  Then use ''${here/title}'' for zWinRMServerName.  This situation can occur when no DNS server is available.  Kerberos always performs a reverse lookup when obtaining a ticket to use a service on a computer.  If your servers are known by multiple names, the reverse lookup may return the wrong name and you will see "Server not found in kerberos database" errors.  See the troubleshooting section on this topic for a solution.

;zWinScheme
: This must be set to either ''http'' or ''https''. The default is ''http''.

;zWinUseWsmanSPN
: If the HTTP/HTTPS service principals are exclusively in use for a particular service account, such as on an IIS server, set this option to true to use the WSMAN service principal name.  You can use this option for all domain joined Windows Servers that are using a domain monitoring account.

{{note}} A domain controller may need “Validated write to service principal name” permission for the NETWORK SERVICE account in order for the WSMAN service principal name to be used.

;zWinRMPort
: The port on which the Windows server is listening for ''WinRM'' or ''WS-Management'' connections. The default is ''5985''. It is uncommon for this to be configured as anything else.

;zWinPerfmonInterval
: The default interval in seconds at which ''Windows Perfmon'' datapoints will be collected. The default is ''300'' seconds or 5 minutes. It is also possible to override the collection interval for individual counters.

;zWinKeyTabFilePath
: This property is currently used and reserved for future use when keytab files are supported.

;zDBInstances
: This setting is only relevant when the ''zenoss.winrm.WinMSSQL'' modeler plugin is enabled. Multiple instances can be specified to monitor multiple SQL Server instances per server using different credentials. The default instance is ''MSSQLSERVER''. Fill in the user and password to use SQL authentication. Leave the user and password blank to use Windows authentication.  The default ''MSSQLSERVER'' credentials will be used for all instances not specified.

;zWinRMEnvelopeSize
: This property is used when the winrm configuration setting for MaxEnvelopeSizekb exceeds the default of 512k.  Some WMI queries return large amounts of data and this envelope size may need to be enlarged.  A possible symptom of this is seeing an xml parsing error during collection.

;zWinRMLocale
: The locale to use for communicating with a Windows server.  The default is ''en-US''.

;zWinRSCodePage
: The code page which is in use on the Windows Server for the monitoring user account.  The default is to use 65001, the identifier for unicode.  The full list is here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317756(v=vs.85).aspx.  To determine the code page in use on a Windows server, run <code>chcp</code> at a command prompt.

;zWinRMKrb5includedir
: Optional directory which contains one or more kerberos configuration files.  This is useful when extra kerberos options are needed, such as disabling reverse dns lookup.  See http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html for a description of ''includedir'' and krb5.conf options available.  The directory must exist and contain only kerberos configuration files.  If the directory contains non-kerberos configuration files, it will be ignored.

{{note}} HyperV and MicrosoftWindows ZenPacks share krb5.conf file as well as tools for sending/receiving data. Therefore if either HyperV or Windows device has a correct zWinKDC setting, it will be used for another device as well.

=== Configuring MSSQL Server Modeling/Monitoring ===

; Supported SQL Server versions:
: SQL Server 2005
: SQL Server 2008
: SQL Server 2008 R2
: SQL Server 2012
: SQL Server 2014
: SQL Server 2016

; Support for SQL Server and Windows Authentication:
* Windows Authentication: In ''zDBInstances'' property specify only SQL instances names, leave user and password fields blank.
* SQL Server Authentication: In ''zDBInstances'' property provide user name and password for each SQL instance.
* Specifying authentication per instance is no longer required with version 2.4.2 and above.  We will use the credentials specified for the MSSQLSERVER instance by default.

Use the following steps to configure SQL Server Authentication on your SQL Server:
# Connect to SQL Instance using MSSQL Management Studio.
# Select instance ''Properties'' > ''Security'' and make sure that ''SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode'' is enabled.
# Open ''Security'' > ''Logins'', select the user you specified in ''zDBInstances'' property or the ''zWinRMUser'' property if using Windows Authentication.
# Check user ''Properties'' > ''Status'' and make sure that the user is Enabled.
# Check user ''Properties'' > ''Server Roles'' and make sure that the user has the ''public'' role.
## If using an Administrator user, make sure it has the ''sysadmin'' role.
## If not using an Administrator user, check user ''Properties'' > ''Securables'' and make sure the user has been granted ''View server state'' rights.

; Support for Local and Failover Cluster SQL instances:

This ZenPack adds support for both local and failover cluster SQL Server instances.
Local SQL Server instances can be modeled/monitored within windows devices (devices in ''Server/Microsoft/Windows'' device class).
SQL Server failover cluster instances can be modeled/monitored within cluster devices (devices in ''Server/Microsoft/Cluster'' device class).

: Use the following steps to model/monitor SQL Server instances:
# Create a device in ''Server/Microsoft/Windows'' device class if you intend to model local SQL instances, or in ''Server/Microsoft/Cluster'' device class if you intend to model failover cluster instances.
# Optionally specify the instance names to be modeled in ''zDBInstances'' zProperty. Provide user names and passwords if SQL Server Authentication is to be used.
# Enable ''zenoss.winrm.WinMSSQL'' modeler plugin.
# Remodel device.

; SQL Server Monitoring

The monitoring templates for SQL Server are component templates so there is no need to perform a bind.  They will automatically be used to monitor databases, instances, and jobs.

{{note}} The default instance of MSSQLSERVER appears as the host name.

{{note}} The authenticated user will need to be granted permission to view the server state.  For example, "GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO 'MYDOMAIN\zenoss_user'" or through the GUI in SQL Server Management Studio.  The user must also be interactive, i.e. the account must not be denied local logon rights.

=== Working with WinCommand Notification Action ===

This ZenPack adds a new event notification action that can be used by the zenactiond daemon to allow an arbitrary command to be executed on the remote windows machine.

Use the following steps to set up a notification:
# Select ''Events'' > ''Triggers'' from the Navigation Menu.
# Create a trigger, selecting the rules that define it.
# Select ''Notifications'' from the left panel. Add a new notification, enter a name for it and select ''WinCommand'' Action from the drop-down menu. Click Submit.
# In the ''Edit Notification'' dialog on the ''Notification'' tab associate the trigger with the notification and optionally select the notification properties (Enabled, Send Clear, Send only on Initial Occurrence, Delay, Repeat).
On the ''Content'' tab of the notification specify the 'Windows CMD Command'' to run when configured triggers are matched. You may optionally specify ''Clear Windows CMD Command'' to run when the triggering event clears.
# Submit changes.

For more information please refer to [http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-10690 Working with Triggers and Notifications]

* winrm s winrm/config/winrs '@{IdleTimeout="7200000"}'

Basic Authentication (Windows default is Kerberos see note below for more information)
* winrm s winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
* winrm s winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'

{{note}} The above instructions use the max values for MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser and WinRS MaxShellsPerUser. If you do not want to set these to the max, then a value of 50 should be adequate. The default is 5 on both, which will cause problems because Zenoss will open up concurrent requests for each WQL query and set of Perfmon counters.

{{note}} If you choose to use Basic authentication it is highly recommended that you also configure HTTPS. If you do not use the HTTPS protocol your user name and password will be sent over in clear text. If you have challenges setting up HTTPS on the Windows clients but require the user name and password to be encrypted, then using the Kerberos authentication is the best option. HTTPS is not required for Kerberos but is recommended. If you choose to use Kerberos authentication, then your payload will be encrypted.

{{note}} If you are using kerberos on EL6 and higher to connect to your Windows Server, your data will be encrypted over HTTP.  For kerberos on EL5, encryption is not supported so you must set the winrm AllowUnencrypted option to true.

{{note}} If you choose to take the WinRM default configurations you must supply Kerberos authentication settings in the zProperties. The Kerberos authentication process requires a ticket granting server. In the Microsoft Active Directory environment the AD Server is also the KDC. The zWinKDC value must be set to the IP address of the AD Server and the collector must be able to sent TCP/IP packets to this server. Once this is set your zWinRMUserName must be a FQDN such as jsmith@Zenoss.com and the zWinRMPassword must be set correctly for this user account.

{{note}} In order to use a single domain user in a child domain or other trusted domain, set zWinKDC to the AD server of the user's domain.  Then enter the trusted domain name and associated AD server in the zWinTrustedRealm and zWinTrustedKDC properties, respectively.

{{note}} The HTTPS setup must be completed on each client. At this time we do not have notes on automating this task but are currently in the process of testing several options. To successfully encrypt your payload between the Zenoss server and the Windows client you must install a Server Authentication certificate on the client machine. The process for requesting and installing the appropriate  certificate can be found at the following URL.
http://blogs.technet.com/b/meamcs/archive/2012/02/25/how-to-force-winrm-to-listen-interfaces-over-https.aspx
Once the client has the correct certificate installed you only need to change the zWinScheme to HTTPS and zWinRMPort to 5986. If you are still having challenges setting up HTTPS on the client you can execute the following command on any AD server to verify the appropriate SPN record exists for Kerberos authentication.

<console>
c:\>setspn -l hostname1
</console>

If you do not see a record with HTTPS/ at the beginning of the hostname you can create the record, but this is not typically necessary as Windows will use the HOST/ record as the default for most built in services.

<console>
c:\>setspn -s HTTPS/hostname1.zenoss.com hostname1
</console>

== Transitioning from WindowsMonitor ==

If you are installing this ZenPack on an existing Zenoss system or upgrading from an earlier Zenoss version you may have a ZenPack named ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' already installed on your system. You can check this by navigating to Advanced -> ZenPacks.

This ZenPack functionally supersedes ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' for Windows platforms that support WinRM, but does not automatically migrate monitoring of your Microsoft Windows resources when installed. The ZenPacks can coexist gracefully to allow you time to manually transition monitoring to the newer ZenPack with better capabilities.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Expand the Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Single-click to select a Windows device.
# Click the delete (''-'') button in the bottom-left.
# Click OK to confirm deleting the Windows device.
# Add the device back using the [[#Adding a Windows Device]] instructions above. Be sure to select the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class and not the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Repeat steps 3-6 for each Windows device.

{{note}} It is also possible to drag and drop selected Windows devices from one class to another.  You will need to remodel the devices after the move.

Old Windows ZenPacks:
* PySamba
* WindowsMonitor
* ActiveDirectory
* IISMonitor
* MSExchange
* MSMQMonitor
* MSSQLServer

New Windows ZenPacks:
* [[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector]] is a requirement for this ZenPack. It provides the polling facility through the zenpython collector daemon.
* This ZenPack (all the functionality of the old Windows ZenPacks is rolled into this one ZenPack)

The old ZenPacks come as part of the Zenoss Core 4.2.x RPM. They can be installed on top of an RM install with the msmonitor RPM

=== Using Old and New Windows ZenPacks Together ===

There are some scenarios where it may be useful to use the old and new Windows ZenPacks together. In most cases this is as simple as putting servers you wish to be monitored by the new ZenPack in the /Server/Microsoft/Server device class and servers you wish to be monitored by the old ZenPack in the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.

Due to this ZenPack's dependency on WinRM 2.0 it is not possible to monitor Windows versions earlier than Windows 2003 SP1. If you have a requirement to monitor these earlier Windows versions you must use the older [[ZenPack::Microsoft_Windows|WindowsMonitor ZenPack]] that uses DCOM/RPC instead of WinRM.

There are also circumstances where you may currently be using the old Windows ZenPack and only want to initially use the new ZenPack for its new functionalities such as the ''Windows Shell'' datasource. This can be achieved using the following steps.

# Keep the servers under the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Verify that all of the following configuration properties are set:
#* ''zWinUser'': In DOMAIN\Username format for DCOM/RPC collection.
#* ''zWinPassword'': Password for zWinUser account.
#* ''zWinRMUser'': In username@example.com format for WinRM collection.
#* ''zWinRMPassword'': Password for zWinRMUser account.
# Create a monitoring template containing a ''Windows Shell'' datasource and bind it to the server.

== Limitations of Current Release ==

The current release is known to have the following limitations.

* Support for team NICs is limited to Intel and Broadcom interfaces.
* The custom widget for MSSQL Server credentials is not compatible with Zenoss 4.1.x, therefore the ''zDBInstances'' property in this version should be set as a valid JSON list (e.g. ''[{"instance": "MSSQLSERVER", "user": "", "passwd": ""}]'' ).
* When upgrading to version 2.2.0, you may see a segmentation fault during the install.  This occurs when upgrading from versions 2.1.3 and previous.  To ensure a successful installation, run the install once more and restart Zenoss.
* Payload encryption is not supported on EL5 systems.  This is due to the fact that the default kerberos library on EL5 systems does not contain the necessary functionality.
* Current functionality for monitoring Server 2003 has not been removed from the ZenPack, but no future development will be done for Server 2003.
* Starting with version 2.6.0 of the ZenPack, existing Windows Service components are no longer compatible.  These will be removed upon installation.  Once the device is modeled with the Services plugin enabled, Windows Service components will be discovered.  Any existing monitoring templates will still apply.  Any services that were manually selected to be monitored will not.  See the section on [[#Configuring Service Monitoring|Configuring Service Monitoring]].

A current list of known issues related to this ZenPack can be found with [https://jira.zenoss.com/issues/?jql=%22Affected%20Zenpack(s)%22%20%3D%20MicrosoftWindows%20AND%20status%20not%20in%20(closed%2C%20%22awaiting%20verification%22)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20id this JIRA query]. You must be logged into JIRA to run this query. If you don't already have a JIRA account, you can [https://jira.zenoss.com/secure/Signup!default.jspa create one here].

=== Kerberos Tickets ===

The ZenPack will automatically generate a kerberos configuration file, krb5.conf, in the $ZENHOME/var/krb5/ directory.  To use a custom configuration file, place it in the $ZENHOME/var/krb5/config/ directory.  In Zenoss 5.x, this location is in a container so you will need to be certain to commit any changes made.  Upgrading Zenoss will lose these changes, so you will need to update your container after upgrade.  The file name can be anything that contains alphanumeric, dashes, and underscores.

To add a permanent location for you configuration file, you can make use of the zWinRMKrb5includedir property.  This must be a location accessible from within a container and contain ONLY kerberos configuration file(s).  If the location is invalid or contains files other than kerberos configuration files, it will be ignored and not added to the main krb5.conf file.

Example:

A common problem with Kerberos is that a reverse DNS lookup will result in multiple records returned, and not always the correct one.  Kerberos by default always performs a forward and reverse lookup when establishing a ticket.  To disable the reverse lookup, create a file in either the default location or in a user specified location and add the following:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
[libdefaults]
  rdns = False
</syntaxhighlight>

See http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html for more information on the includedir and other kerberos options.

You can also supply multiple KDCs for a domain with the Windows ZenPack.  This can be done using either a comma separated list in the zWinKDC property or supplying single KDCs for multiple devices or device classes under the /Server/Microsoft device class.

This list also supports a simple regex to add, remove, and specify an admin_server.

;Adding a KDC
* Use just the address or append a ''+'' to the beginning of the address to add a new kdc.

;Removing a KDC
* Append a ''-'' to the beginning of the KDC address to remove an existing KDC from the krb5.conf file.  This can be used if a KDC is no longer in service or if the wrong address was entered previously.  This can be removed from zWinKDC once a ticket granting ticket for the user has been obtained and the krb5.conf file is correct.

; Specifying an admin_server
* Optionally, use an asterisk, ''*'', to denote the admin_server.  If none is provided, the first kdc in the list will be used.  The admin_server is used for any admin work, such as changing a password through kinit.

For example, set zWinKDC to ''*10.10.10.10,10.10.10.20,+10.10.10.30,-10.10.10.40'' for specifying a comma separated list.  10.10.10.10 will be a kdc and admin_server, 10.10.10.20 and 10.10.10.30 will be added as kdcs, and 10.10.10.40 is no longer a valid kdc address and will be removed.

{{note}} Removing one or more errant KDCs from the system can be a time consuming process, so we recommend double-checking that the addresses are valid when entering them into the zWinKDC property.

== Service Impact ==

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds built-in service impact capability for services running on Microsoft Windows.

== Troubleshooting ==

Please refer the Zenoss Service Dynamics documentation if you run into any of the following problems:

* ZenPack will not install
* Adding a device fails
* Don't understand how to add a device
* Don't understand how to model a device

If you cannot find the answer in the documentation, then Resource Manager (Service Dynamics) users should contact [https://support.zenoss.com Zenoss Customer Support]. Core users can use the #zenoss IRC channel or the community.zenoss.org forums (there is a forum specific to Windows monitoring).

=== Troubleshooting Windows ===

If you see 100% CPU usage on a domain controller and your forest functional level is Windows 2003 or Windows 2008, you could be missing the WinRMRemoteWMIUsers__ security group.  Adding this group to your domain should fix this problem.  It is a known error from Microsoft, https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118385.

=== Troubleshooting Kerberos Error Messages ===

<blockquote>Cannot determine realm for numeric host address</blockquote>

* If you enter an IP address for the device id, make sure that the address is resolvable to a name.  Common solutions to this is to use the zWinRMServerName property.

<blockquote>Server not found in Kerberos database</blockquote>

* More often than not, this error indicates a DNS issue in which the domain controller is unable to locate the specified server by either IP address or name.  The best solution varies over different domains and it is left to the user to decide which is best for their environment.

One solution is to disable reverse DNS lookups for kerberos.  This can be achieved by creating a file with the following contents:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
[libdefaults]
  rdns = False
</syntaxhighlight>

Then place the file into either the /opt/zenoss/var/krb5/config directory or into any other directory that you specify using the zWinRMKrb5includedir property.  See the description for zWinRMKrb5includedir for more information.

<blockquote>Preauthentication failed while getting initial credentials.</blockquote>

* This typically indicates a bad or expired password.

<blockquote>Realm not local to KDC while getting initial credentials</blockquote>

* This indicates that one or more of the defined KDCs for a domain are incorrect.  Add a ''-'' to the beginning of the errant KDC address to the beginning of the incorrect address in the zWinKDC property to remove it from the list of KDCs for a domain.

=== Troubleshooting Kerberos Authentication with Wireshark ===

There are many reasons for kerberos authentication not to work, and a lot of them result in the following unhelpful error message.

<blockquote>kerberos authGSSClientStep failed (None)</blockquote>

While Zenoss is unable to extract a useful error message when this occurs, it turns out that Wireshark can get useful errors by looking at the kerberos packets sent between Zenoss, your domain controller (''zWinKDC'') and the monitored Windows server. Let's walk through an example of using [http://www.wireshark.org/ Wireshark] to resolve an ''authGSSClientStep failed'' error.

# First install Wireshark on your system. It's GUI is easier to use than the command line equivalent.
# Next you will need to create a packet capture file on your Zenoss server. Assuming the Windows server you're trying to monitor is ''192.0.2.101'' and the domain controller (''zWinKDC'') is ''203.0.113.10'', you would run the following command as the root user on your Zenoss server.
#: <console>tcpdump -s0 -iany -w kerberdebug.pcap host 192.0.2.101 or host 203.0.113.10</console>
#: This will start capturing all packets to or from those two IP addresses. It will continue to capture these packets until you type ''CTRL-C''.
# Now you should attempt to remodel the Windows server where you're encountering the error. Once it completes, and fails, again you should go back to the terminal where tcpdump is running and type ''CTRL-C''. You will now have a ''kerberdebug.pcap'' file in the directory where you ran the command.
# Copy ''kerberdebug.pcap'' to your system where you installed Wireshark. Start Wireshark and open ''kerberdebug.pcap''. You should see something like the following.
#: [[File:windows-kerberos-wireshark.png]]

You'll see that there's a ''KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW'' error. Searching for this specific error code will quickly show that it occurs when the kerberos client and server don't have their time's synchronized. There's a tolerance for some difference, but in this case it was a big difference due to misconfiguration.

There are some kerberos errors you'll see in the packets that a completely normal part of negotiation and won't lead to any problems. You should ignore the following errors shown in Wireshark:

* ''KRB5KRB_API_ERR_TKT_EXPIRED'': Zenoss will subsequently request a new ticket when this occurs.
* ''KRB5KRB_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED'': This is a normal part of kerberos negotiation.
* ''KRB5KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG'': Most requests won't fit in UDP. Zenoss will automatically switch to TCP.

You'll also see other kerberos messages that are normal. You should ignore these kerberos messages shown by Wireshark:

* ''TGS-REQ''
* ''AS-REQ''

The following are the most common errors:
* ''KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW'': As shown in the above example. A clock synchronization issue.
* ''KRB5KDC_ERR_S_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN'': This can happen if ''zWinRMServerName'' resolves to the server's IP address, but is not the name the server is known by in Active Directory. This will also be the error if you don't enter a ''zWinRMServerName'' and the reverse resolution of the device's manage IP address resolves to a name that doesn't match the server's name in Active Directory.  Typical solutions to this are to add the name to the /etc/hosts file or to directly use the IP address of the server.

=== Troubleshooting on Resource Manager 4.1.1 ===

In some cases updating the Microsoft Windows ZenPack on Zenoss Resource Manager 4.1.1 may result in the ''zenhub'' daemon not starting. The error message will contain ''AttributeError: zDBInstancesPassword''. If you encounter this issue, install the ZenPack again.

If there are existing SQL server instances being monitored, make sure to reconfigure ''zDBInstances'' property since the ''zDBInstancesPassword'' property no longer exists.

=== Troubleshooting Services ===

If you see an event error that shows "The maximum number of concurrent operations for this user has been exceeded", you will need to increase the number of concurrent operations per user in the winrm config.
For example:
* winrm set winrm/config/service '@{MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser="5000"}'

If you see an "Index out of range" error, this could indicate a low number of available file handles in Linux.  The default is 1024.  To view this information on your system, enter 'ulimit -n'.  To increase this limit, edit your /etc/sysctl.conf file and set fs.file-max to a sufficiently large number.
For example:
* vi /etc/sysctl.conf
* fs.file-max=10000

=== Troubleshooting monitoring ===

The first step in troubleshooting any monitoring issues is to scan the zenpython log for errors.

While monitoring, possible network connectivity issues may occur while trying to complete the Get-Counter command.
If you experience OperationTimeout errors, it may be a solution to decrease value of ''zWinPerfmonInterval'' property to 30 seconds.

Other timeout issues on a domain could involve having a large Kerberos token.  This could be caused by the user belonging to a large number of groups.  See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/970875 for more information on the cause and resolution.  Possible side effects of a large token include high CPU usage on the Windows server.

If you see a corrupt counters error event, this indicates that the specified counters have been corrupted on the Windows device.  No data will be collected for the specified counters until the counters have been repaired on the device and zenpython has been restarted.

If you see the following error, check the zenhub log for errors:

* Configuration for 10.111.5.171 unavailable -- is that the correct name?

=== Troubleshooting modeling/monitoring ===

Version 2.6.0 introduces a command line option to save modeling/monitoring results for troubleshooting.  This option will save the results returned from a Windows server from a modeler or datasource plugin.  This data can then be viewed/tested using unit tests to determine issues.

Usage:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
export ZP_DUMP=1;zenmodeler run -d server1.example.com --collect=Interfaces; unset ZP_DUMP
</syntaxhighlight>

This will unload a pickle of the results to a file in the /tmp folder called Interfaces_process_XXXXXX.pickle.

{{note}} Be sure to unset the environment variable to avoid unwanted pickle files.
