=== Event Management ===
Events could be collected from the Windows event log using a WinRM subscription. Events collected through this mechanism will be timestamped based on the time they occurred within the Windows event log. Not by the time at which they were collected.

To monitor EventLog events you should add to monitoring template with "Windows EventLog" datasource. For the Event Log field put the name of event log (e.g. "System") that you are interested in, and in the EventQuery you could put the filter for events. Filter is written as PowerShell scriptblock for Where-Object commandlet. 

To target all events with a Warning or higher severity:

For Windows 2003: <code>{ $$_.EntryType -le [System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType]::Warning}</code>

<code>$$_</code> is the event object of EventLogEntry class. <code>EntryType</code> - is the attribute which determines severity, and could contain one of the following values: <code>Error, Warning, Information, SuccessAudit</code>, or <code>FailureAudit</code>. Also it has such attributes as <code>Message</code>, <code>MachineName</code>, <code>TimeGenerated</code>, <code>Source</code>. Full list you could find at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.diagnostics.eventlogentry .

Note: This query is structured to look for "less than," although we are looking for events "greater than" in severity. This is because the EntryType is an enumeration where the integer values map to 1= Error, 2 = Warning, etc. This means lower numbers indicate higher severity.

For Windows 2008 & Later: 

<code>{ $$_.Level -le [System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.StandardEventLevel]::Warning}</code>

The full list of event levels can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.reader.standardeventlevel%28v=vs.110%29.aspx

For more information about the System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader class, you could read http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.reader(v=vs.110).aspx

And to know more about writing PowerShell conditions, you could read http://www.powershellpro.com/powershell-tutorial-introduction/powershell-tutorial-conditional-logic/ 


To change event severity follow the steps:
# go to IIS Site events, and click on '/Status' event class.
# find 'EventClass Mappings' section and click on 'IISSiteStatus' link
# click the ''Edit'' button
# in the 'Transform' section, add "<code>evt.severity = <severity number(see link http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-3923 in the '#7.1.1.3. severity Field' section)></code>" at the bottom
# click the ''Save'' button

=== Custom Commands ===
You can use the custom command datasource in the Windows ZenPack to create custom data points, graphs and thresholds.

* Use either DOS shell commands or Powershell script
** Use any valid Windows executable or Powershell cmdlet
** Powershell commands separated by ';'.  Always end script with ';'
** For tales eval, surround by single quotes.  e.g. '${here/id}'
** For Powershell variables, use 2 '$'.  e.g. $$myvar = 10
** There is a character limit of 8192 imposed by Microsoft.  Zenoss header is ~450 characters so you have about 7500 characters for your script.
* Use standard parser to parse the output or create your own
** Nagios have the form <key>=<value>
** JSON - script must put data into JSON format
** Auto will save a returned value into a data point.
** Create custom parser in $ZENOSS_HOME/Products/ZenRRD/parsers/
* Viewing script output
** Create datapoint(s) to collect the data for graphing
** Create custom parser to send event or transform data

==== Example usage ====

;Script with TALES expression
# Select a windows target device
# Navigate to Device (/Server/Microsoft)
# On the right side panel, click '+' to add a 'Windows Shell' datasource
# Provide name (eg. custom) and type (Windows Shell) for the datasource
# View Edit and Details
# Set strategy to custom command
# Set parser to Nagios
# Uncheck Use Powershell
# Set script to echo 'OK^|value1=${here/zWinPerfmonInterval}'
# Add data point to data source called value1 which can be graphed

;Using a custom parser
Logon to the zenoss server and create a python file called test1.py in /opt/zenoss/Products/ZenRRD/parsers and restart zenoss

The content of test1.py

 <nowiki>
from Products.ZenRRD.CommandParser import CommandParser
 class test1(CommandParser):
    def processResults(self, cmd, result):
        result.events.append({
            'summary':'test1 parser event',
            'severity': 5,
            'test1.detail': cmd.deviceConfig.name,
            })
</nowiki>

# Select a windows target device
# Navigate to Device (/Server/Microsoft)
# On the rigt side panel, click '+' to add a 'Windows Shell' datasource
# Provide name (eg. custom) and type (Windows Shell) for the datasource
# View Edit and Details : strategy ->custom command and parser is test1
# Run zenpython to collect the data zenpython run -v10 -d <devicename>
# Check events after 5 minutes for the test1 event

;Powershell Scripting using Auto parser

# Select a windows target device
# Navigate to Device (/Server/Microsoft)
# On the right side panel, click '+' to add a 'Windows Shell' datasource
# Provide name (eg. custom) and type (Windows Shell) for the datasource
# View Edit and Details : strategy ->custom command, parser is Auto, and tick the Use Powershell box
# Enter script.  Be sure to use a double dollar sign, '$$', in order to distinguish any powershell specific variables from a TALES expression.
# Add a datapoint to collect the return value from the script which you can then graph

== Requirements ==

This ZenPack has the following requirements.

;[[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector ZenPack]]
: This ZenPack depends on [[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector]] being installed, and having the associated ''zenpython'' collector process running.

;System Kerberos RPM
: The operating system's kerberos RPM must be installed. See the [[#Installing_Kerberos_Dependency]] section for details.

=== Installing Kerberos Dependency ===

To use kerberos authentication the operating system's kerberos package must be installed on all Zenoss servers. On Enterprise Linux (Red Hat and CentOS) this is the ''krb5-workstation'' RPM and can typically be installed by running the following command as the ''root'' user.

<console>
yum -y install krb5-workstation
</console>

== Usage ==

=== Adding a Windows Device ===

Use the following steps to start monitoring a Windows server using local authentication in the Zenoss web interface.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Select the Server/Microsoft/Windows device class.
#* The Windows server must be added to this class or to a child of this class.
# Click Details and set the configuration properties for zWinRMUser and zWinRMPassword.
# Click See All.
# Choose ''Add Single Device'' from the add device button.
# Fill out the form.
#* ''Name or IP'' must be resolvable and accessible from the collector server chosen in the ''Collector'' field.
# Click ''ADD''.

----

Alternatively you can use zenbatchload to add Windows servers from the command line. To do this, you must create a text file with hostname, username and password of all the servers you want to add. Multiple endpoints can be added under the same ''/Devices/Server/Microsoft/Windows'' section. Here is an example...

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
/Devices/Server/Microsoft/Windows
win2003-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
win2008-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
Win2012-1d.example.com zWinRMUser="Administrator", zWinRMPassword="password"
</syntaxhighlight>

You can then load the Windows servers into Zenoss Core or Resource Manager as devices with the following command.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
zenbatchload <filename>
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Configuration Options ===

The [[#Adding a Windows Device]] steps shown above are for the simplest case of using Windows local authentication. The following configuration properties can be used to support monitoring other environments.

;zWinRMUser
: The syntax used for zWinRMUser controls whether Zenoss will attempt Windows local authentication or domain (kerberos) authentication. If the value of zWinRMUser is ''username'', local Windows authentication will be used. If zWinRMUser is ''username@example.com'', domain authentication will be used. The zWinKDC and potentially the zWinRMServerName properties become important.

;zWinRMPassword
: Password for user defined by ''zWinRMUser''.

;zWinKDC
: The zWinKDC property must be set if domain authentication is used. It must be the IP address of a valid Windows domain controller.

;zWinRMServerName
: This property should only be used in conjunction with domain authentication when the DNS PTR record for a monitored server's managed IP address does not resolve to the name by which the server is known in Active Directory. For example, if myserver1 is known as myserver1.ad.example.com by Active Directory and is being managed by IP address 192.51.100.21, but 192.51.100.21 resolves to www.example.com, you will have to set zWinRMServerName to ''myserver1.ad.example.com'' for domain authentication to work.

: If many Windows servers in your environment don't have DNS PTR records that match Active Directory, it is recommended that you set the name of the Zenoss device's to be the fully-qualified Active Directory name and set zWinRMServerName to ''${here/titleOrId}'' at the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class. This avoids the necessity of setting zWinRMServerName on every device.

: It is recommended to leave zWinRMServerName blank if local authentication is used, or DNS PTR records match Active Directory. This allows Zenoss to not rely on DNS resolution while monitoring, and avoids the overhead of configuring zWinRMServerName.

;zWinScheme
: This must be set to either ''http'' or ''https''. The default is ''http''.

;zWinRMPort
: The port on which the Windows server is listening for ''WinRM'' or ''WS-Management'' connections. The default is ''5985''. It is uncommon for this to be configured as anything else.

;zWinPerfmonInterval
: The default interval in seconds at which ''Windows Perfmon'' datapoints will be collected. The default is ''300'' seconds or 5 minutes. It is also possible to override the collection interval for individual counters.

;zWinKeyTabFilePath
: This property is currently used and reserved for future use when keytab files are supported.

;zDBInstances
: This setting is only relevant when the ''zenoss.winrm.WinMSSQL'' modeler plugin is enabled. Multiple instances can be specified to monitor multiple SQL Server instances per server. The default instance is ''MSSQLSERVER''. Fill in the user and password to use SQL authentication. Leave the user and password blank to use Windows authentication.

=== Configuring Service Monitoring ===

There are multiple ways to configure Windows service monitoring depending on if you want to configure for a single service on a single server, a specific service across all Windows servers, all 'Auto' start services, or somewhere in between.

See the following examples:

;Enable or disable monitoring for a single service on a single server.
# Navigate to the service on the server.
# Click to select it.
# Choose ''Monitoring'' from the gear menu.
# Choose Yes or No depending on what you want.

;Enable monitoring by default for the WinRM service wherever it is enabled.
# Navigate to Advanced -> Monitoring Templates.
# Verify the list of templates is grouped by template.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree.
# Click once to select the ''/Server/Microsoft'' copy.
# Choose ''Copy / Override Template'' from the gear menu.
# Select ''/Server/Microsoft (Create Copy)'' from the target list then click submit.
# Expand the resulting ''copy_of_WinService'' tree.
# Select the ''/Server/Microsoft'' copy.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the gear menu.
# Change the template's name to ''WinRM''.
# Change ''Start mode of service to monitor'' from 'None' to 'Auto' then click save.

;Enable/Disable monitoring by default for the WinRM service for a select group of servers.
# Create a new device class somewhere under ''/Server/Microsoft/Windows'' for the select group of servers.
# Move the servers to the new device class.
# Follow steps 1-5 from the previous section.
# Choose your new device class as the target then click submit.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree then select the copy in your device class.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the gear menu.
# Change the template's name to ''WinRM'' then click submit.
# Double-click to edit the ''DefaultService' datasource.
# Change ''Start mode of service to monitor'' from 'None' to 'Auto' to enable or leave it as 'None' to disable monitoring by default then click save.

;Enable monitoring of all services with a start mode of 'Auto'.
# Navigate to Advanced -> Monitoring Templates.
# Verify the list of templates is grouped by template.
# Expand the ''WinService'' tree.
# Select ''/Server/Microsoft''.
# Choose ''View and Edit Details'' from the Data Sources gear menu.
# Change ''Start mode of service to monitor'' from 'None' to 'Auto' then click save.

{{note}} To enable monitoring by default of a service or services, you must choose a start mode other than 'None'.  Choosing 'None' disables monitoring by default.

=== Configuring MSSQL Server Modeling/Monitoring ===

; Supported SQL Server versions:
: SQL Server 2005
: SQL Server 2008
: SQL Server 2008 R2
: SQL Server 2012

; Support for SQL Server and Windows Authentication:
* Windows Authentication: In ''zDBInstances'' property specify only SQL instances names, leave user and password fields blank.
* SQL Server Authentication: In ''zDBInstances'' property provide user name and password for each SQL instance.

Use the following steps to configure SQL Server Authentication on your SQL Server:
# Connect to SQL Instance using MSSQL Management Studio.
# Select instance ''Properties'' > ''Security'' and make sure that ''SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode'' is enabled.
# Open ''Security'' > ''Logins'', select the user, you specified in ''zDBInstances'' property.
# Check user ''Properties'' > ''Status'' and make sure that the user is Enabled.
# Check user ''Properties'' > ''Server Roles'' and make sure that the user has ''sysadmin'' and ''public'' roles.

; Support for Local and Failover Cluster SQL instances:

This ZenPack adds support for both local and failover cluster SQL Server instances.
Local SQL Server instances can be modeled/monitored within windows devices (devices in ''Server/Microsoft/Windows'' device class).
SQL Server failover cluster instances can be modeled/monitored within cluster devices (devices in ''Server/Microsoft/Cluster'' device class).

: Use the following steps to model/monitor SQL Server instances:
# Create a device in ''Server/Microsoft/Windows'' device class if you intend to model local SQL instances, or in ''Server/Microsoft/Cluster'' device class if you intend to model failover cluster instances.
# Specify the instance names to be modeled in ''zDBInstances'' zProperty. Provide user names and passwords if SQL Server Authentication is to be used.
# Enable ''zenoss.winrm.WinMSSQL'' modeler plugin.
# Remodel device.

=== Working with WinCommand Notification Action ===

This ZenPack adds a new event notification action that can be used by the zenactiond daemon to allow an arbitrary command to be executed on the remote windows machine.

Use the following steps to set up a notification:
# Select ''Events'' > ''Triggers'' from the Navigation Menu.
# Create a trigger, selecting the rules that define it.
# Select ''Notifications'' from the left panel. Add a new notification, enter a name for it and select ''WinCommand'' Action from the drop-down menu. Click Submit.
# In the ''Edit Notification'' dialog on the ''Notification'' tab associate the trigger with the notification and optionally select the notification properties (Enabled, Send Clear, Send only on Initial Occurrence, Delay, Repeat).
On the ''Content'' tab of the notification specify the 'Windows CMD Command'' to run when configured triggers are matched. You may optionally specify ''Clear Windows CMD Command'' to run when the triggering event clears.
# Submit changes.

For more information please refer to [http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-10690 Working with Triggers and Notifications]

== <span id="winrm_setup">Setting up WinRM Service for Target Windows Machines</span> ==

Windows server operating systems from Windows 2003 SP1 are supported. The reason for this is that WinRM version 2 is required, and it was only added in Windows 2003 SP1.

Basic Authentication (Windows default is Kerberos see note below for more information)
* winrm s winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
* winrm s winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}

{{note}} The above instructions use the max values for MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser and WinRS MaxShellsPerUser. If you do not want to set these to the max, then a value of 50 should be adequate. The default is 5 on both, which will cause problems because Zenoss will open up concurrent requests for each WQL query and set of Perfmon counters.

{{note}} If you choose to use Basic authentication it is highly recommended that you also configure HTTPS. If you do not use the HTTPS protocol your user name and password will be sent over in clear text. If you have challenges setting up HTTPS on the Windows clients but require the user name and password to be encrypted, then using the Kerberos authentication is the best option. HTTPS is not required for Kerberos but is recommended. If you choose to use Kerberos authentication, then your payload will be encrypted.

{{note}} If you are using kerberos to connect to your Windows Server, your data will now be encrypted over HTTP.

{{note}} If you choose to take the WinRM default configurations you must supply Kerberos authentication settings in the zProperties. The Kerberos authentication process requires a ticket granting server. In the Microsoft Active Directory environment the AD Server is also the KDC. The zWinKDC value must be set to the IP address of the AD Server and the collector must be able to sent TCP/IP packets to this server. Once this is set your zWinRMUserName must be a FQDN such as jsmith@Zenoss.com and the zWinRMPassword must be set correctly for this user account.

{{note}} The HTTPS setup must be completed on each client. At this time we do not have notes on automating this task but are currently in the process of testing several options. To successfully encrypt your payload between the Zenoss server and the Windows client you must install a Server Authentication certificate on the client machine. The process for requesting and installing the appropriate  certificate can be found at the following URL.

Once the client has the correct certificate installed you only need to change the zWinScheme to HTTPS and zWinRMPort to 5986. If you are still having challenges setting up HTTPS on the client you can execute the following command on any AD server to verify the appropriate  SPN record exists for Kerberos authentication.

setspn -l hostname1

If you do not see a record with HTTPS/ at the beginning of the hostname you will need to create the record.

example:
setspn -s HTTPS/hostname1.zenoss.com hostname1

== Transitioning from WindowsMonitor ==

If you are installing this ZenPack on an existing Zenoss system or upgrading from an earlier Zenoss version you may have a ZenPack named ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' already installed on your system. You can check this by navigating to Advanced -> ZenPacks.

This ZenPack functionally supersedes ''ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor'' for Windows platforms that support WinRM, but does not automatically migrate monitoring of your Microsoft Windows resources when installed. The ZenPacks can coexist gracefully to allow you time to manually transition monitoring to the newer ZenPack with better capabilities.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Expand the Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Single-click to select a Windows device.
# Click the delete (''-'') button in the bottom-left.
# Click OK to confirm deleting the Windows device.
# Add the device back using the [[#Adding a Windows Device]] instructions above. Be sure to select the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class and not the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Repeat steps 3-6 for each Windows device.

Old Windows ZenPacks:
* PySamba
* WindowsMonitor
* ActiveDirectory
* IISMonitor
* MSExchange
* MSMQMonitor
* MSSQLServer

New Windows ZenPacks:
* [[ZenPack:PythonCollector|PythonCollector]] is a requirement for this ZenPack. It provides the polling facility through the zenpython collector daemon.
* This ZenPack (all the functionality of the old Windows ZenPacks is rolled into this one ZenPack)

The old ZenPacks come as part of the Zenoss Core 4.2.x RPM. They can be installed on top of an RM install with the msmonitor RPM

=== Using Old and New Windows ZenPacks Together ===

There are some scenarios where it may be useful to use the old and new Windows ZenPacks together. In most cases this is as simple as putting servers you wish to be monitored by the new ZenPack in the /Server/Microsoft/Server device class and servers you wish to be monitored by the old ZenPack in the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.

Due to this ZenPack's dependency on WinRM 2.0 it is not possible to monitor Windows versions earlier than Windows 2003 SP1. If you have a requirement to monitor these earlier Windows versions you must use the older [[ZenPack::Microsoft_Windows|WindowsMonitor ZenPack]] that uses DCOM/RPC instead of WinRM.

There are also circumstances where you may currently be using the old Windows ZenPack and only want to initially use the new ZenPack for its new functionalities such as the ''Windows Shell'' datasource. This can be achieved using the following steps.

# Keep the servers under the /Server/Windows/WMI device class.
# Verify that all of the following configuration properties are set:
#* ''zWinUser'': In DOMAIN\Username format for DCOM/RPC collection.
#* ''zWinPassword'': Password for zWinUser account.
#* ''zWinRMUser'': In username@example.com format for WinRM collection.
#* ''zWinRMPassword'': Password for zWinRMUser account.
# Create a monitoring template containing a ''Windows Shell'' datasource and bind it to the server.

== Limitations of Current Release ==

The current release is known to have the following limitations.

* Support for team NICs is limited to Intel and Broadcom interfaces.
* The custom widget for MSSQL Server credentials is not compatible with Zenoss 4.1.x, therefore the ''zDBInstances'' property in this version should be set as a valid JSON list (e.g. ''[{"instance": "MSSQLSERVER", "user": "", "passwd": ""}]'' ).
* When upgrading to version 2.2.0, you may see a segmentation fault during the install.  This occurs when upgrading from versions 2.1.3 and previous.  To ensure a successful installation, run the install once more and restart Zenoss.

A current list of known issues related to this ZenPack can be found with [https://jira.zenoss.com/issues/?jql=%22Affected%20Zenpack(s)%22%20%3D%20MicrosoftWindows%20AND%20status%20not%20in%20(closed%2C%20%22awaiting%20verification%22)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20id this JIRA query]. You must be logged into JIRA to run this query. If you don't already have a JIRA account, you can [https://jira.zenoss.com/secure/Signup!default.jspa create one here].

=== Manually Establishing Kerberos Tickets ===

In version 2.2.0 of the ZenPack it is now possible to add custom kerberos configurations if your settings differ from the default settings used by Zenoss.  To use a custom configuration file, place it in the $ZENHOME/var/krb5/config/ directory.  This option requires kerberos 5 release 1.10 and higher.

In version 2.0.0 of the ZenPack there is a problem in the automatic establishment of kerberos tickets required for monitoring Windows devices using kerberos authentication. This is only a problem on Enterprise Linux 5 (Red Hat or CentOS). It is not a problem on Enterprise Linux 6. The problem will typically manifest as the following error when attempting to model a Windows device.

{{note}} Note that these manual steps are not necessary in version 2.0.1 and later of the ZenPack.

<blockquote>
kerberos authGSSClientStep failed (None)
</blockquote>

It is possible to workaround this error by manually establishing the tokens using the following steps.

# Edit $ZENHOME/var/krb5/krb5.conf.
## Remove the ''includedir'' line.
## Add the following to the bottom of the file.

<pre>
[realms]
 EXAMPLE1.COM = {
  kdc = 192.168.77.77 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
  admin_server = 192.168.77.77 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
 }
 EXAMPLE2.COM = {
  kdc = 192.168.88.88 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
  admin_server = 192.168.88.88 #KDC IP Address or FQDN
 }

[domain_realm]
 .example1.com = EXAMPLE1.COM
 example1.com = EXAMPLE1.COM
 .example2.com = EXAMPLE2.COM
 example2.com = EXAMPLE2.COM
</pre>

This is an example of what would be required if you had two domains: example1.com and example2.com with domain controllers at 192.168.77.77 and 192.168.88.88 respectively. You can use a single domain or more than two. Be sure to use the same capitalization scheme.

== Service Impact ==

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds built-in service impact capability for services running on Microsoft Windows. The following service impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included in any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.

;Service Impact Relationships
* The Windows server is impacted by the Processors and File Systems.

== Troubleshooting ==

Please refer the the Zenoss Service Dynamics documentation if you run into any of the following problems:

* ZenPack will not install
* Adding a device fails
* Don't understand how to add a device
* Don't understand how to model a device

If you cannot find the answer in the documentation, then Resource Manager (Service Dynamics) users should contact [https://support.zenoss.com Zenoss Customer Support]. Core users can use the #zenoss IRC channel or the community.zenoss.org forums (there is a forum specific to Windows monitoring).

=== Troubleshooting Kerberos Error Messages ===

<blockquote>Cannot determine realm for numeric host address</blockquote>

* If you enter an IP address for the device id, make sure that the address is resolvable to a name.

<blockquote>Server not found in Kerberos database</blockquote>

* Either the HTTP or HTTPS service principal name cannot be found on the device.  You can add it using the setspn program on the Windows Server.

example:
setspn -s HTTP/hostname1.zenoss.com hostname1

=== Troubleshooting Kerberos Authentication with Wireshark ===

There are many reasons for kerberos authentication not to work, and a lot of them result in the following unhelpful error message.

<blockquote>kerberos authGSSClientStep failed (None)</blockquote>

While Zenoss is unable to extract a useful error message when this occurs, it turns out that Wireshark can get useful errors by looking at the kerberos packets sent between Zenoss, your domain controller (''zWinKDC'') and the monitored Windows server. Let's walk through an example of using [http://www.wireshark.org/ Wireshark] to resolve an ''authGSSClientStep failed'' error.

# First install Wireshark on your system. It's GUI is easier to use than the command line equivalent.
# Next you will need to create a packet capture file on your Zenoss server. Assuming the Windows server you're trying to monitor is ''192.0.2.101'' and the domain controller (''zWinKDC'') is ''203.0.113.10'', you would run the following command as the root user on your Zenoss server.
#: <console>tcpdump -s0 -iany -w kerberdebug.pcap host 192.0.2.101 or host 203.0.113.10</console>
#: This will start capturing all packets to or from those two IP addresses. It will continue to capture these packets until you type ''CTRL-C''.
# Now you should attempt to remodel the Windows server where you're encountering the error. Once it completes, and fails, again you should go back to the terminal where tcpdump is running and type ''CTRL-C''. You will now have a ''kerberdebug.pcap'' file in the directory where you ran the command.
# Copy ''kerberdebug.pcap'' to your system where you installed Wireshark. Start Wireshark and open ''kerberdebug.pcap''. You should see something like the following.
#: [[File:windows-kerberos-wireshark.png]]

You'll see that there's a ''KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW'' error. Searching for this specific error code will quickly show that it occurs when the kerberos client and server don't have their time's synchronized. There's a tolerance for some difference, but in this case it was a big difference due to misconfiguration.

There are some kerberos errors you'll see in the packets that a completely normal part of negotiation and won't lead to any problems. You should ignore the following errors shown in Wireshark:

* ''KRB5KRB_API_ERR_TKT_EXPIRED'': Zenoss will subsequently request a new ticket when this occurs.
* ''KRB5KRB_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED'': This is a normal part of kerberos negotiation.
* ''KRB5KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG'': Most requests won't fit in UDP. Zenoss will automatically switch to TCP.

You'll also see other kerberos messages that are normal. You should ignore these kerberos messages shown by Wireshark:

* ''TGS-REQ''
* ''AS-REQ''

The following are the most common errors:
* ''KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW'': As shown in the above example. A clock synchronization issue.
* ''KRB5KDC_ERR_S_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN'': This can happen if ''zWinRMServerName'' resolves to the server's IP address, but is not the name the server is known by in Active Directory. This will also be the error if you don't enter a ''zWinRMServerName'' and the reverse resolution of the device's manage IP address resolves to a name that doesn't match the server's name in Active Directory.  Typical solutions to this are to add the name to the /etc/hosts file or to directly use the IP address of the server.

=== Troubleshooting on Resource Manager 4.1.1 ===

In some cases updating the Microsoft Windows ZenPack on Zenoss Resource Manager 4.1.1 may result in the ''zenhub'' daemon not starting. The error message will contain ''AttributeError: zDBInstancesPassword''. If you encounter this issue, install the ZenPack again.

If there are existing SQL server instances being monitored, make sure to reconfigure ''zDBInstances'' property since the ''zDBInstancesPassword'' property no longer exists.

=== Troubleshooting Services ===

If you see an event error that shows "The maximum number of concurrent operations for this user has been exceeded", you will need to increase the number of concurrent operations per user in the winrm config.
For example:
* winrm set winrm/config/service '@{MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser="5000"}'

If you see an "Index out of range" error, this could indicate a low number of available file handles in Linux.  The default is 1024.  To view this information on your system, enter 'ulimit -n'.  To increase this limit, edit your /etc/sysctl.conf file and set fs.file-max to a sufficently large number.
For example:
* vi /etc/sysctl.conf
* fs.file-max=10000

== Zenoss Analytics ==

This ZenPack provides additional support for Zenoss Analytics. Perform the
following steps to install extra reporting resources into Zenoss Analytics
after installing the ZenPack.

# Copy analytics-bundle.zip from <tt>$ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.zenoss.Microsoft.Windows*/ZenPacks/zenoss/Microsoft/Windows/analytics/</tt> on your Zenoss server.
# Navigate to Zenoss Analytics in your browser.
# Login as superuser.
# Remove any existing ''Microsoft Windows ZenPack'' folder.
## Choose ''Repository'' from the ''View'' menu at the top of the page.
## Expand ''Public'' in the list of folders.
## Right-click on ''Microsoft Windows ZenPack'' folder and choose ''Delete''.
## Confirm deletion by clicking ''OK''.
# Add the new ''Microsoft Windows ZenPack'' folder.
## Choose ''Server Settings'' from the ''Manage'' menu at the top of the page.
## Choose ''Import'' in the left page.
## Remove checks from all check boxes.
## Click ''Choose File'' to import a data file.
